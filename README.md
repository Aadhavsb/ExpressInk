# ExpressInk

ExpressInk is a web application designed to help parents understand their children's emotional states through image analysis. By uploading images (drawn by children), ExpressInk utilizes OmniStack's pre-trained models to detect moods and infer mental states based on contextual cues within the images. This tool is particularly useful for parents/teachers of kids who are on the autism spectrum and are non-verbal.
